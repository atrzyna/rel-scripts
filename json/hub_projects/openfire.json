  "longDescription": "The Hazelcast plugin adds support for running multiple redundant Openfire servers together in a cluster. By running Openfire as a cluster, you can distribute the connection load among several servers, while also providing failover in the event that one of your servers fails. This plugin is a drop-in replacement for the original Openfire clustering plugin, using the open source Hazelcast data distribution framework in lieu of an expensive proprietary third-party product.",
