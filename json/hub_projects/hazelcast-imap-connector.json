  "shortDescription": "Fetches entries from a Hazelcast distributed map, follows the map change events or updates the map.",
  "longDescription": "Connects Jet to an <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#map\">IMap</a> in local or remote Hazelcast cluster. \r \r The source connector fetches entries from a Hazelcast IMap using a predicate or projection. In streaming mode, it continuously consumes IMap change log. \r \r Sinks write entries to an IMap using <code>map.put()</code> or using an <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-dev/manual/html-single/index.html#entry-processor\" target=\"_blank\">Entry Processor</a> to update the entries in IMap instead of replacing.\r \r The connector is included in the base Jet package. No plugin download is required.\r \r The connector makes use of data locality when reading from local Hazelcast maps.",
