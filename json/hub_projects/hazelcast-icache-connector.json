  "longDescription": "Connects Jet to <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#hazelcast-jcache-extension-icache\">ICache</a> in local or remote Hazelcast cluster.   The source connector fetches entries from a Hazelcast ICache using a predicate or projection. In streaming mode, it continuously consumes ICache change log.   Sinks write entries to an ICache using <code>map.put()</code>.  The connector is included in the base Jet package. No plugin download is required.  The connector makes use of data locality when reading from local Hazelcast caches.",
